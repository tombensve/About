# Demented Coder (:-)

_I have been diagnosed with early onset dementia! This means 
that I have quite bad short term memory! Old stuff is still there! I no longer work, but I'm still 
coding in my own pace here on Github, and will continue until the compiler screams too much at me!_

----

Anyone that are using any of my stuff should consider cloning to your own repo. That said, since I 
don't pay for an open source account on GitHub, this will likely not go away.
