# For anyone using any of my code!

Much of my code here on GitHub was done quite some time ago, some projects are newer.

**I am 56 years old (at this moment) and have been diagnosed with early onset dementia! This means 
that I have quite bad short term memory! Old stuff is still there! I no longer work, but I'm still 
coding in my own pace here on Github, and will keep doing so until it is no loger possible!**

I will mark some of my repos as "no longer maintained"! 

_CodeLicenseManager_ will be one of these!

I will start new projects for myself to play with to try keep my brain gooing!

I will try to keep MarkdownDoc running as long as I can. 

Anyone that are using any of my stuff consider cloning to your own repo if you haven't 
already. That said, since I don't pay for an open source account on GitHub,
this will likely not go away.
